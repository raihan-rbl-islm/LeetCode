# 1768. Merge Strings Alternately

**Difficulty:** Easy  
**Topic:** String, Two Pointers  
**Link:** [LeetCode 1768](https://leetcode.com/problems/merge-strings-alternately/)

## Intuition

The problem requires merging two strings by taking characters in alternating order. We can use a single loop that continues as long as there are characters left in either string. Inside the loop, we check if the current pointer is within the bounds of its respective string and append the character if valid.

## Complexity

* **Time Complexity:** $O(N + M)$ — We iterate through both strings exactly once.
* **Space Complexity:** $O(1)$ — Auxiliary space is constant (excluding the result string).

## Code (C++)

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    string mergeAlternately(string word1, string word2) {
        string result = "";
        // Optimization: result.reserve(word1.size() + word2.size())
        
        int i = 0, j = 0;
        while (i < word1.size() || j < word2.size()) {
            if (i < word1.size()) result += word1[i ++];
            if (j < word2.size()) result += word2[j ++];
        }
        return result;
    }
};
