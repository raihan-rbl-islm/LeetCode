# 1431. Kids With the Greatest Number of Candies

**Difficulty:** Easy  
**Topic:** Array, Greedy  
**Link:** [LeetCode 1431](https://leetcode.com/problems/kids-with-the-greatest-number-of-candies/)

## Intuition

To determine if a kid can have the greatest number of candies, we first need to know what the current maximum is. We can do this in two passes:
1. Find the maximum number of candies (`maxCandies`) currently held by any kid.
2. Iterate through each kid's candy count, add `extraCandies`, and check if the sum is greater than or equal to `maxCandies`.

## Complexity

* **Time Complexity:** $O(N)$ — We iterate through the array twice (once to find the max, once to generate the result).
* **Space Complexity:** $O(1)$ — Auxiliary space is constant (excluding the output vector).

## Code (C++)

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    vector<bool> kidsWithCandies(vector<int>& candies, int extraCandies) {
        // Find the current maximum number of candies
        int maxCandies = *max_element(candies.begin(), candies.end());
        
        vector<bool> result;
        // Optimization: Pre-allocate memory to avoid resizing overhead
        result.reserve(candies.size());
        
        for (int candy : candies) {
            result.push_back(candy + extraCandies >= maxCandies);
        }
        
        return result;
    }
};
